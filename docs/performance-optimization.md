# **Performance Optimization ðŸš€**

## **Real-time Location Tracking Optimizations**

### 1. Memory Management
- Uses `useRef` for channel and region references to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Proper cleanup of subscriptions using `useCallback` for memory leak prevention

### 2. State Updates Optimization
- Efficient state updates using `useState` and `useCallback`
- Memoized callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized location updates by only updating changed user positions

### 3. Location Filtering Performance
- Implements spatial filtering for nearby users
- Adjusts duplicate locations automatically to prevent overlapping markers
- Uses constant radius boundaries (BUYER_RADIUS, SELLER_RADIUS) for efficient filtering

### 4. Network Optimization
- Implements region-based filtering to reduce unnecessary data transmission
- Uses Supabase's real-time channels for efficient bi-directional communication
- Presence tracking for live user status without polling

### 5. User Experience Optimizations
- Immediate UI updates for location changes
- Efficient notification system with mark-as-read functionality
- Smart filtering to exclude self from nearby users list
